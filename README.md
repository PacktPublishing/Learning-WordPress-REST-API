###Software and Hardware Requirements

| Chapter number | Software required (With version) | Hardware specifications | OS required |
|:--------------:|:--------------------------------:|:-----------------------:|:-----------:|
| 1 | Relevant coding language (if implementing REST API in non-PHP/JS) | Code editor of choice; relevant libraries | Linux; Win; Mac |
| 2-9 | WordPress (version 4.3 and above; latest version recommended) PHP 5.4 (preferably higher) Compatible version of MySQL (MariaDB and other enhanceents accepted) | For custom queries, 512 MB of pMem and 512 MB of vMem is preferred to ensure a stable environment (WP in itself can operate at much lesser than that); API calls might need I/O speeds at 2 MB/s If running on shared hosting, make sure your host allows concurrent MySQL connections. | Linux (LAMP stack); Windows (WAMP); if Apache is not available, WP can run well on NGINX or LiteSpeed as well. |
